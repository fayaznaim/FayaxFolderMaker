FayaxFolderMaker
A small utility to create folders, hundreds, thousands of them. The "Simulate" button is very imprtant as it does NOT create the foldrers but it will simulate the creation of the folders and shows you what you are about to create.

** Folder names cannot create certain characaters ** ** If a folder already exists in the target directory, a new folder with the same name will NOT be created. **

In the tab titled "List to folders": You can paste a list of words which will be your folder names.

In the tab titled "Numbered", numbered folders can be created and als static names, prefixes, postfixes can be added.

In the tab titled "Calendar" weekday and month name folders.

The third tab is 'Custom Folders" and you can type whatever folder name you want to have creeated.

Fourth Tab "From Textfile" will read the textfile that you point to to get the names of the folders.

Fifth Tab, "Specialized Folder" has some predefined folder names. I will add more here as I come across some that might be useful. Please feel free to make some suggesstions.

About Tab: Contains information like the one in this readme.
